			<button type="button" class="collapsible">Lithium</button>
			<div class="content_div">
				<p class="content">
					Lithium is a 3D game engine written in C++ and OpenGL for 64-bit Windows. It has been under development since 2019.
				</p>

				<p class="content">
					It currently supports a complex material system, a system for mounting assets, and several custom file types. Alongside these engine features, it comes packaged with a capable filesystem manager which supports both normal file loading as well as file streaming.
				</p>

				<p class="content">
					Lithium is currently unavaliable, but will be made avaliable once enough features are supported to allow for users to easily create games.

			<button type="button" class="collapsible">MatrixUtil</button>
			<div class="content_div">
				<p class="content">MatrixUtil is a library written in C++ as well as Intel SIMD Intrinsics for handling vector and matrix operations. The library is designed with 3D graphics programming in mind.</p>

			<button type="button" class="collapsible">LScript</button>
			<div class="content_div">
				<p class="content">
					LScript is an in-development statically typed scripting language (kind of). The language supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. The source code compiles to a bytecode which is read by the virtual machine which features many features similar to the Java Virtual Machine. The LScript Virtual Machine, compiler, and decompolier are all written entirely in C and x86-64 Assembly.
				</p>

				<p class="content">
					The virtual machine provides features such as a set of library functions for developers to use, as well as a native interface so developers can write native C or C++ functions and link to an LScript function.
